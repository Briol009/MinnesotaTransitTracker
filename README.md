# Minnesota Transit Tracker: Real-Time Monitoring for Commuters 

The Minnesota Transit Tracker: Real-Time Monitoring for Commuter Map aims to provide riders across Minnesota with real-time tracking capabilities. This project uses live data from public transit APIs and displays the data dynamically on a map interface. The map displays the Green and Blue metro transit lines, along with real-time tracking of buses on their respective routes. The map uses visualizations and standard map practices to enhance the user experience.
